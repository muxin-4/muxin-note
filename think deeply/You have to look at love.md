#### How I Met Your Mother actor's lines
I'm in love with her,okay?
if you're looing for the word that means caring about someone
beyond all rationality and wanting them to have everying they want,
no matter how much it destroys you
It's love!
And when you love someone, you just, you...
you don't stop,ever.
Even when people roll there eyes or call you crazy.
Even then,especially then.
you just, you don't give up!Because if i could give up...
If i could just, you know, take the whole world's advice
and-and move on and find someone else,that wouldn't be love
that would be some other disposable thing
that is not worth fighting for.

#### summarize
- Nice but idealistic
- love depends on attraction
- Love yourself before others love you
- In the same way, how do you meet a VIP,good social circles
- As a person of great worth, you will naturally meet people of great worth and social circle
- Don't think about what I want from you before making friends. What do you think I can give him
- There are so many things you can't control in your life, such as love and relationships. It's better to focus your attention, time and experience on yourself.
